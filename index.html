<h2 >Why I made this website.</h2>

<p>Welcome to my website, the reason I made this website is because it was tasked by my professor. We are learning HTML, CSS and soon Javascript. It is one of my curiousity back then on how websites are made.</p>

<h2>I love riding motorcycles</h2>

<p>Grand adventures await those who are willing to turn the corner. You must be open to trying a new experience.  I had always wanted to ride a motorcycle but lived in fear to ride.  Part of my fear came from media images. Motorcyclists have been publicly profiled to be troublemakers and bad boys.  Many Americans tend to reference motorcycle clubs and motorcyclist as nuisance.  I also became fearful due to the reports of motorcycle deaths and injuries. These stories influenced my beliefs; therefore, I believed riding a motorcycle was terrifying.   My point of view changed after I took my first motorcycle ride. I was determined to find out for myself if there was anything to really fear. I knew if I wanted to ride a motorcycle I would have to take the state required motorcycle course.  I researched the prices, classes, and called in to talk to the instructors.</p>
